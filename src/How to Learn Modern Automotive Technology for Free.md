One of the most comprehensive and authoritative textbooks on modern automotive technology is *Modern Automotive Technology*, 8th Edition, by James E. Duffy. This book covers the construction, operation, diagnosis, service, and repair of late-model automobiles and light trucks. It uses a building-block approach that starts with the fundamental principles of system operation and progresses gradually to complex diagnostic and service procedures. It also includes updated information on hybrid drive systems, computer control technology, electrical and electronic systems, fuel injection systems, emission control systems, and more.
 
However, this textbook is not cheap. It costs around $120 on Amazon, and even more on other websites. So how can you access this textbook for free? Here are some possible ways:
 
- Check your local library. Libraries often have copies of textbooks that you can borrow for free or for a small fee. You can also use their computers and internet access to read online versions of the textbook or related materials.
- Search online for PDF versions of the textbook. Some websites offer free downloads of textbooks in PDF format. However, be careful of the quality and legality of these downloads. Some of them might be incomplete, outdated, or pirated. For example, one website that claims to offer a free PDF download of *Modern Automotive Technology*, 8th Edition is YUMPU[^3^]. However, this website requires you to sign up for a free trial and provide your credit card information before you can access the download. This might be risky and not worth it.
- Use online platforms that offer free or low-cost courses on modern automotive technology. Some examples are Coursera, edX, Udemy, Khan Academy, and YouTube. These platforms offer courses on various topics related to modern automotive technology, such as engine fundamentals, electrical systems, hybrid technology, emission control systems, etc. Some of these courses are taught by experts from universities or industry partners. You can learn at your own pace and get certificates or badges upon completion.

As you can see, there are some ways to learn modern automotive technology for free or at a low cost. However, none of them can replace the quality and depth of *Modern Automotive Technology*, 8th Edition by James E. Duffy. If you are serious about learning modern automotive technology, you might want to invest in this textbook or find a way to access it legally.
 
In conclusion, modern automotive technology is a fascinating and dynamic field that requires constant learning and updating. If you want to learn more about it, you can use some of the options mentioned above to access *Modern Automotive Technology*, 8th Edition by James E. Duffy for free or at a low cost.
